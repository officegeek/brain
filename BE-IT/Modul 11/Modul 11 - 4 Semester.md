## Design of Complex IT Systems, Domains, Processes and Decisions
Students learn how to work with the design of complex IT systems, domains, processes and decisions based on selected theories of IT architecture, distributed systems, service management, systems development, decision theory and data science as well as a number of new technologies, including microservice, domain driven design and machine learning. 

### Knowledge
The student has gained development-based knowledge, understanding and an ability to reflect on applied theories, methods and tools regarding

* Artificial intelligence and neural networks
* Handling of Business Intelligence data in organisations
* Data set visualisation
* NoSQL databases
* Data-driven decision theory, including selected decision problems from the fields of mathematics, computer science, operations research and / or cybernetics and use of the same in response to business-related issues
* Incremental development of IT systems, including Microservice architectures and DevOps
* APIs and their business application, Web Services and Service-oriented IT architecture
* Frameworks for working with IT architecture
* The importance of IT architecture in business agility and systems development
* Virtualisation and associated techniques, containers and cloud systems.
* Issues and methods for establishing security in IT systems, including SSL, VPN, encryption, certificates and virus scanning
* Privacy by design

### Skills
The student masters skills related to the use of theory of methods regarding

* Design of complex, loosely coupled IT systems with a focus on information gathering and modelling of business domains
* Design of a strategic service vision including a service concept and definition of the need for service delivery systems and their IT content
* Design and use of machine learning solutions, including associated data handling
* Design and development of business processes based on a rational data-driven business perspective
* Use of APIs
* Use of a virtual environment
* Design, development and testing of distributed IT systems
* Decision-making in project management.

### Competencies
The student is able to handle complex and development-oriented issues regarding

* Use of data in business processes including decision-making, decision support and decision systems.

The student is able to participate independently in work with

* IT business analysis, including analysis and design of an IT system in accordance with domain needs of a business
* Design of IT systems to support business and decision-making processes
* Development and continued development of complex distributed and virtual IT systems in multidisciplinary collaboration.

The student is able to identify their own learning requirements and develop their own knowledge, skills and competencies in relation to
